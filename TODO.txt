THINGS TO DO:

1. Convert center of mass (c.o.m.) POSE to c.o.m. position vector (rotate inertia before discarding orientation) X
2. Combine inertia for merged links using parallel axis theorem X
3. Convert frames (joint, c.o.m.) of merged links to reference frames (return pointer to a pose?)
4. Number joints
5. Compute forward kinematics
	a) base pose * joint offset (if attached to base)
	b) previous joint pose * joint offset (if not attached to base)
	c) angular velocity = previous angular velocity + joint contribution
6. Compute inverse dynamics
	a) Transform c.o.m. to base frame
	b) Compute Jacobian to c.o.m.
	c) Compute time derivative of Jacobian
	d) Sum up inertia matrix
	c) Sum up Coriolis matrix
	d) Sum up gravity vector
